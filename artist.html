<p>Most of my art pieces were considered not up to standard according to my critique.
    Therefore, I made some changes and posted the best pieces on the website.
    I have a complex relationship with art when I was 12 and I continued to practice sketching the 
    human anatomy and how body parts work rather than drawing what I wanted to draw.
    This training fortunately translated into my knowledge of anotomical features that helped me with 
    these art pieces.
